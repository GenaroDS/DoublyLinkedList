# DoublyLinkedList
I have implemented a doubly linked list consisting of three classes. The first class is DoubleNode, which contains a head, a tail, and a product.  
Each node, except for the first and last, has a head pointer pointing to the previous node and a tail pointer pointing to the next node, as well as a Product object as the body/data. The head pointer for the first node is null, and the tail pointer for the last node is also null. Each time a new node is inserted, it is placed in ascending order according to its product code.  
The implementation also includes error handling, such as displaying an error message if you attempt to use a Product Code that is already in use.
This app doesn't have an user interface, but you can see its console output down below:
